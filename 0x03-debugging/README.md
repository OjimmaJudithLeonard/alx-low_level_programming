0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

0. Multiple mains mandatory In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project: Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

1. Like, comment, subscribe mandatory Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972? This program prints the largest of three integers. That’s definitely not right.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Line count will not be checked for this task.

3. Leap year mandatory This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
